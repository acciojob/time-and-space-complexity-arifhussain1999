	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science, quantifying an algorithm's runtime in relation to input size using big O notation. Efficient algorithms have low time complexity, ensuring good performance as input grows. Lower complexities like O(log n) or O(n) are considered more efficient than higher ones (e.g., O(n^2)). Striving for efficiency is essential in algorithm design for optimal performance, especially with large datasets or time-sensitive applications.</p>
	<p>Space complexity, expressed as O(f(n)), measures an algorithm's memory usage relative to input size. Efficient algorithms have low space complexity, ideally O(1) for constant space usage or O(n) for linear growth. Balancing time and space complexity is crucial in algorithm design, especially in resource-constrained environments or when handling extensive datasets.</p>
